<h2>Themes of research and main results</h2>
<p>
Security of end-in-end for co-operative systems ITS<br>
We continued the works undertaken in the Cifre thesis with Renault entitled Securing Future Cooperative ITS Applications within the framework as of projects ISE and SCOOP@F.<br> The details are given in the sections (Activities at the VeDeCoM Institute/Activities with the IRT SystemX)<br>

In the thesis in Co-supervision (ParisTech Telecom – NTU (Singapore)) of Heng Chuan Tan who relates to the mechanisms of security in the vehicular networks with a grid, we suggested a management solution of keys lightweight which consitute an alternative to the approach which uses the certificates with an architecture IGC (infrastructure of management of keys or PKI (Public Key Infrstructure)).<br> Our objective is to reduce the cost of calculation in the embarked units (in the vehicles and the units edge of road), to reduce the indication of the communication protocols while ensuring the security level required in an environment on a large scale.<br> Several tenders are in hand (2 reviews and 1 conference).
</p>

<h3>Co-operation networks STOWNET – cellular networks 4G</h3>
<p>
We continued work of the year 2013-2014.<br> Publications are in the course of tender on a proposal which optimizes the unloading of cells 4G in the case of a transmission multi-flow.<br> We proposed an analytical model, named FOSAA, which evaluates the capacity of a vehicular network to support a cellular traffic in a context of offload of the cellular infrastructure by the means of communications V2V (vehicle with vehicle) and I2V (vehicle with infrastructure) opportunist.<br> FOSAA takes into account the constraints relating to the existence of links V2V, I2V; capacity of the channel; aggregation; the time of activity of the nodes and the saturation of the channel.<br> Simulations showed the effectiveness of FOSAA to select the traffic adequate multi-flow with offloader.
</p>
<h3>Modeling of the co-operation by means of the theory of games</h3>
<p>
We studied the use of approach EGT for adjuster the number of nodes relay runners in order to disseminate information in a network ad hoc vehicular by optimizing the rate of dissemination and the use of the band-width.<br> Based on our previous works published in the conference IEEE ICC2014, we spread the work.<br> Two publications were subjected (an article subjected to IEEE VTC' 16 and one article sousmis to the newspaper IEEE Transactions one Vehicular Technology (the second resubmission following corrections).
</p>
			
<h2>Activities with the VeDeCoM Institute/Activities with the IRT SystemX</h2>

<h3>•Project ELA, Numeric security (with Renault, PSA, ECA)</h3>
<p>I ceased my activity within project ELA to at the end of November 2014 devote me to my work in project ISE.<br>An article concerning the realized risk analysis was published [1].</p>

<h3>·	 ISE project, a project with Renault and PSA</h3>
<p>The ISE project  objective is to bring the bricks of safety necessary for the deployment of the security system for the systems cooperative ITS.<br> ParisTech telecom takes part in 4 tasks of theproject and I am the leader of task 1 Analyzeapplications ITS, analyze risks and security solutions E2E.<br> I undertake to make the connection between the projects ISE and SCOOP@F.<br> I will be brought, with the current of the year 2016, to contribute to the installation of the co-operation with the VeDeCoM Institute.</p>

<h1>International collaborations</h1>
			<p>With Professeur Ian Aykildiz, Ken Byers Chair Professeur with the University Goergia Institute of Technology, Director of the Laboratory Broadband Wireless Networking Lab, that I invited last year, we collaborated on the topic of the co-operative networks without wire, two publications were subjected (see section 7.3).<br>
With Sherali Zeadally, Associate professor (Associate Professor Tenured) at the University of Kentucky the United States, we published an article in the Ad hoc newspaper Networks Newspaper.

</p>
<h2>Participation in the assembly of a WP DigiCosme on the topic of the wireless networkings</h2>
			<p>I took part in the assembly of a working group “Performances, QoS and management of resources of the dynamic wireless networkings”.<br> The set of themes of this working group fits in the axis ComEx of Labex DigiCosme.<br> It is focused on the performances of the wireless networkings, the analysis of QoS and the management of resources in the case of the dynamic networks such as the ad hoc networks, the networks mesh, the networks of sensors, the heterogeneous networks, the vehicular networks, Wireless-SDN. <br>The goal of this working group is to be a place of exchanges on this set of themes through the behaviour of monthly seminars utilizing at the same time the colleagues of the group and their teams like some external invited researchers.<br> The group is financed by Digicosme for one 2 years duration and envisages the behaviour of 8 seminars a year.<br> It is consisted researchers of: LTCI, Samovar, PRISM, LRI, ECA, INRIA, Supélec.</p>
<h1>Integration activities and valorization of research</h1>

<h2>research contracts</h2>

<h3>SCOOP@F (2014-2016)</h3>
			<p>
SCOOP@F is a very important national project financed by the European Commission (budget: 20 Million Euros) and controlled by ministry MEDDE/DGITM.<br> It is the first pilot project of deployment of the co-operative intelligent transportation systems (co-operative ITS) in France.<br> It is a project of deployment on a large scale (3000 vehicles and 2000 km of roads) most important in Europe.</p>

<h3>Activity within the European Commission</h3>
			<p>
The European Commission, very driving, set up financings as well as a European platform for co-operative systems ITS.<br> I take part in working group WG5 of the platform europénne C-ITS on the security and certification since April 2015.<br> Work in this group has strong interactions with the group of Amsterdam and also with group WG5 of the ETSI TC ITS and consortium C2C.
			</p>
<h3>Development of a platform of test Security ITS</h3>
			<p>
The group SR started in June the development project a platform to validate the mechanisms of security for co-operative systems ITS.<br> It is about a platform the purpose of which is to be able to realize is tests on table with computers or with equipment ITS (OBU, RSU).<br>This platform understands an architecture PKI.<br> We will initially validate the transmission of secure messages of some cases of use specified for wave 1 of SCOOP@F.</p>

<h3>SCOOP@F (2016-2018)</h3>
			<p>
I worked with the other partners of the SCOOP@F project to deposit in March 2015 a request file of subsidy for an extension of the project over the period 2016-2018 within the framework of the call for projects of the EC “Mechanism of Interconnection for Europe”.<br> We wrote the technical appendix.<br> I will be responsible for all the linked activities to the security system.<br> ParisTech telecom will work in partnership with OpenTrust, Brittany Telecom and Mines ParisTech.<br> ParisTech telecom will collaborate with Orange on the topic of the hybrid communications (cellular (3G/4G), ITS-G5).

			</p>
<h3>FUI16 LCI4D (2014-2017)</h3>
			<p>
I am interested in the co-operative routing multichemin with heterogeneous interfaces without wire (Wi-Fi, super Wi-Fi (WS), LTE relai) by taking into account constraints on the capacity, the availability and energy.<br> The first results of this work will be subjected to the conference IEEE ICC 2016.<br>


Participation in the WP DigiCosme “Performances, QoS and management of resources of the dynamic wireless networkings” with my enquiring colleagues of: LTCI, Samovar, PRISM, LRI, ECA, INRIA, Supélec.
			</p>
<h3>Standardisation activities</h3>
			<p>
Working with Renault, we wrote a draught IETF second which spread the job accomplished the last year on the extension of the protocol TLS to support two new types of certificates used in systems co-operative ITS which are certificates ETSI and certificates IEEE 1609. 2<br>With Renault, our objective is to start an activity pushed on the protocol TLS in the organisms of normalisation ETSI and IETF.<br> These jobs are led with my colleague Ahmed Sehrouchni editor of the RFC 4279 «Pre-shared key ciphersuites for transport layer security TLS».<br>
Moreover, the activity which I led in plan SCOOP@F on questions not yet solved into term of standardization (PKI, strategy of change of pseudonyms, transportation of requests PKI, service announcement, access control in services, transportation of Logs) has bouti in pertinent proposals which provoked a big interest on behalf of the authorities of normalisation.<br> with Renault and PSA, Telecom ParisTech has as objective to launch necessary actions to the concerned authorities of standardization (ETSI WG2, ETSI WG5, C2C) and working parties (Amsterdam Group, WG5-WG6-WG7 of Platform C-ITS).

			</p>

<h3>SCOOP@F (2014-2018)</h3>
			<p>
SCOOP@F a very important national plan financed by the European Commission (budget is: 20 Million Euro) and piloted by the ministry MEDDE / DGITM.<br>It is the first plan of pilot deployment of the co-operative clever systems of transport (co-operative ITS) in France.<br>These systems are based on communications and distribution of information between vehicles, road facilities and facilities of communication with a view to giving services which improve security and comfort of the users.<br>The general co-operative functioning of the ITS who will be tested in SCOOP@F is illustrated by the diagramme below:<br>
